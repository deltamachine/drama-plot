# Plot Visualization: Topic Trends in Russian Drama

## What is this all about?


## Data
I'm going to use Russian Drama Corpus aka RusDraCor as the data source. The corpus is available on its [website](https://dracor.org/rus) and also in [this Github repository](https://github.com/dracor-org/rusdracor). It contains 210 plays of X authors.

## Action plan
- [x] Create a repository for the project
- [x] Download the corpus
- [ ] Do some text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization/stemming, removal of stop words, POS-tagging)
- [ ] Reimplement the topic modelling algorithm from [Fisher, Pavlova, 2018]
- [ ] Think about how many topics I want to use
- [ ] ...to be continued

## Goals 
Baseline:
- To visualize trends which different topics show in different plays (taking fig.1 - fig.3 from [Schmidt, 2015] as an example)

Follow-up ideas:
- work in progress
