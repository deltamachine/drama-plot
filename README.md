# Plot Visualization: Topic Trends in Russian Drama

## What is this all about?

## Data
I'm going to use Russian Drama Corpus aka RusDraCor as the data source. The courpus is available on its [website](https://dracor.org/rus) and also in [this Github repository](https://github.com/dracor-org/rusdracor). It contains 210 plays of X authors.

## Action plan
- [x] Create a repository for the project
- [x] Download the corpus
- [ ] Do some text preprocessing
- [ ] Reimplement the topic modelling algorithm from [Fisher, Pavlova 2018]
- [ ] Think about how many topics I want to use

## Goals 
Baseline:
- bam

Follow-up ideas:
- whatever
