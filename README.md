# Plot Visualization: Topic Trends in Russian Drama

## What is this all about?
Studying plot with DH methods might help us to identify some plot shapes and topic development patterns which might occur in different plays and potentially be specific for a genre, an author or a period. I want to apply [Schmidt, 2015] approach to Russian plays, extract topics from the data and try to visualize them in order to show how a plot can be characterized.

## Data
I'm going to use Russian Drama Corpus aka RusDraCor as the data source. The corpus is available on its [website](https://dracor.org/rus) and also in [this Github repository](https://github.com/dracor-org/rusdracor). It contains 210 plays of X authors.

## Roadmap
- [x] Create a repository for the project
- [x] Download the corpus
- [ ] Do some text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization/stemming, removal of stop words, POS-tagging)
- [ ] Reimplement the topic modelling algorithm from [Fisher, Pavlova, 2018]
- [ ] Think about how many topics I want to use
- [ ] ...to be continued

## Goals 
Baseline:
- To visualize trends which different topics show in different plays (taking fig.1 - fig.3 from [Schmidt, 2015] as an example)

Follow-up ideas:
- work in progress
